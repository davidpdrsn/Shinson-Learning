Shinson Learning
================

Shinson Learning is a Rails 4 app on Ruby 2.0 and deployed to Heroku.

Development
-----------

### Setup
1. Install PostgreSQL. If you're on a Mac this can be done using the [Postgres app](http://postgresapp.com). If you're on Windows or Linux then you're on your own.

2. Make sure you have at least Ruby 2.0.0. If you don't then I recommend [Rbenv](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv).

3. Get the code.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/davidpdrsn/Shinson-Learning.git
```

4. Setup your environment

```
$ bin/setup
```

5. Run the server to check that everything works

```
$ bin/rails server
```

Then visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
