  <h1>Newest features:</h1>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Updated design</strong><br>
      I have been working on many small tweaks to the design. Everything should be a little nicer too look at and should be more maintainable in the future.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Add multiple techniques at once</strong><br>
      You can now add multiple techniques at once. This is super useful for quickly adding lots of techniques.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Neglected studies</strong><br>
      When logged in the front page now shows studies you might have neglected. That would be studies you have never studied, or not studied for two weeks.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Speed!</strong><br>
      Many performance optimizations have been made that should make the site feel faster.
